- Additional keys for abilities (dash, attack, etc.)

## 4. **Level Design & World**

### Tile System
- **Static Platforms**: Solid ground, walls, ceilings
- **Moving Platforms**: Horizontal/vertical movement
- **Special Tiles**: Spikes, trampolines, breakable blocks
- **Background Elements**: Decorative, non-interactive

### Level Components
- **Start Point**: Player spawn location
- **End Point**: Level exit/goal
- **Checkpoints**: Save progress within level
- **Secret Areas**: Hidden passages and bonus sections

### World Structure
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Different themes/environments (forest, cave, castle, etc.)
- Boss levels or special challenge stages

## 5. **Enemies & AI**

### Basic Enemy Types
- **Walkers**: Move left/right, turn at edges
- **Jumpers**: Hop around, can jump gaps
- **Flyers**: Move in patterns through air
- **Stationary**: Guard specific areas

### AI Behaviors
- Patrol patterns
- Player detection and chasing
- Different movement speeds and abilities
- Death animations and scoring

## 6. **Items & Collectibles**

### Collectible Items
- **Coins/Gems**: Score and currency
- **Keys**: Unlock doors or areas
- **Power-ups**: Temporary abilities
- **Health Items**: Restore player health

### Interactive Objects
- **Doors**: Require keys to open
- **Switches**: Activate platforms or remove barriers
- **Treasure Chests**: Contain valuable items

## 7. **Physics & Collision System**

### Physics Implementation
- Gravity affecting player and objects
- Velocity and acceleration calculations
- Terminal velocity limits
- Friction for ground movement

### Collision Detection
- **Platform Collisions**: Standing on solid ground
- **Wall Collisions**: Preventing movement through walls
- **Enemy Collisions**: Damage or enemy defeat
- **Item Collisions**: Collection mechanics

## 8. **User Interface**

### HUD Elements
- Health/Lives display
- Score counter
- Collected items (keys, coins)
- Mini-map (optional)

### Menu Systems
- Main menu with play, options, quit
- Pause menu
- Settings menu (volume, controls)
- Level select screen

## 9. **Audio System**

### Sound Effects
- Jump sounds
- Footstep sounds
- Item collection sounds
- Enemy defeat sounds
- Damage/death sounds

### Music
- Background music for different levels
- Menu music
- Victory/defeat music
- Dynamic music that changes with game state

## 10. **Visual Elements**

### Graphics & Animation
- Sprite sheets for character animations
- Tile sets for level construction
- Particle effects (dust, explosions)
- Screen transitions and effects

### Visual Polish
- Parallax scrolling backgrounds
- Camera following player smoothly
- Screen shake effects
- Lighting effects (optional)

## 11. **Game Features**

### Core Features
- Multiple levels with progression
- Score system and high scores
- Save/load game progress
- Multiple difficulty settings

### Advanced Features (Optional)
- Power-up system with different abilities
- Multiple playable characters
- Local multiplayer support
- Level editor for custom levels

## 12. **Technical Considerations**

### Performance
- Efficient sprite rendering
- Collision optimization
- Memory management for large levels
- Frame rate consistency (60 FPS target)

### Data Management
- Level data storage (JSON/XML files)
- Save game system
- Settings persistence
- Asset loading and management

## 13. **Development Phases**

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Basic player movement and jumping
2. Simple platform collision
3. Basic level rendering

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay
1. Enemy implementation
2. Item collection system
3. Multiple levels
4. Basic UI

### Phase 3: Polish & Features
1. Audio integration
2. Visual effects and animations
3. Menu systems
4. Save/load functionality

### Phase 4: Testing & Balance
1. Gameplay testing and balancing
2. Bug fixes and optimization
3. Additional content and features

## 14. **Implementation Tips**

### Getting Started
- Start with a simple player rectangle that can move and jump
- Implement basic physics before adding complex features
- Use pygame.sprite.Group for managing game objects
- Keep code modular and organized from the beginning

### Best Practices
- Use constants for game settings (screen size, colors, speeds)
- Implement a proper game state manager
- Separate game logic from rendering
- Use delta time for frame-independent movement
- Plan your collision detection system early

### Common Pygame Patterns
- Sprite classes inheriting from pygame.sprite.Sprite
- Using pygame.sprite.spritecollide() for collision detection
- Implementing a camera/viewport system for larger levels
- Using pygame.mixer for audio management

## 15. **Resources & Tools**

### Essential Pygame Modules
- `pygame.sprite` - Sprite management
- `pygame.image` - Image loading and manipulation
- `pygame.mixer` - Audio playback
- `pygame.font` - Text rendering
- `pygame.time` - Frame rate control

### Recommended Tools
- **Graphics**: Aseprite, GIMP, or Photoshop for sprites
- **Audio**: Audacity for sound effects
- **Level Design**: Tiled map editor for level layouts
- **Version Control**: Git for project management

This outline provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing a pygame platformer. Start with Phase 1 and gradually build up complexity as you implement each system.
